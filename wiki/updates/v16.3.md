## Details

### Standalone app

You can now install the wallet app as a standalone app on macOS, iOS, and Android. This solves a major issue on iOS / macOS, that the browser sometimes automatically deletes all wallet data if you don't visit the site for 7 days. As standalone apps, the wallets are guaranteed to be permanently stored and won't be auto-deleted by the browser or the operating system.

To install the standalone apps, go to [app.otpwallet.xyz](https://app.otpwallet.xyz) (or [1wallet.crazy.one](https://1wallet.crazy.one) for Harmony special version), then

- on macOS: (use Safari or Safari Technology Preview) click the share icon on the top right of the browser, then click "Add to Dock". After that, close the browser window. You can now launch the wallet app as a standalone app from the dock.

- on iOS:  (use Safari) click the share button in the buttom, swipe up (scroll down) on the share sheet, click "Add to Homescreen". After that, close the browser window. You can now launch the wallet app as a standalone app from the home screen, and you can find the app in search bar, just like any other app you installed from App Store.

### Customizable wallet

You can now configure your wallet name, lifespan, spending limit, and recovery address before you create the wallet. To do that, click "Customize" button at the bottom of wallet creation screen. Choose desired wallet name and lifespan before scanning the QR code using your authenticator. After you confirm your authenticator's verification code, you will be able to change spending limit and recovery address in the next screen.

### Contacts

You can now manage and label addresses in the "Contacts" page. You may click on any address to edit its label, or add new contact from the top of the page. If you have a large number of contacts and want to search for a particular address, you may use the address format switcher to make the search easier.

### NFT Rescue Tool

This tool is designed for victims whose wallet got drained by hackers and have a drain-bot attached to the wallet. The victim still has NFTs left in their wallet, which they want to move to other wallets. Victims are unable to do anything by themselves because when a drain bot is attached to the victim's wallet, any fund sent to that wallet will be quickly transferred to a hacker's wallet, causing victim's transactions to fail for unable to pay gas.

In other words, it makes you spam NFT transactions faster than the hacker who is draining your wallet. This tool will be made available for other networks in the future, such as on Ethereum.
